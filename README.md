# AtMem

[![Version 1.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue)](./docs/releases/v1.0.0.md)
[![CI](https://github.com/aetna000/atmem/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aetna000/atmem/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**AtMem is an Agent Black Box and reversible memory control plane for OpenClaw.**

It records the boundaries OpenClaw exposes—model input/output fingerprints, context injection, tool requests, tool completions and turn termination—into a tamper-evident flight timeline. When an agent says it completed an action, an operator can inspect whether the host actually observed the corresponding tool lifecycle and export the evidence.

The boundary is deliberate: AtMem verifies retained timeline integrity and observed hook closure. It does **not** semantically judge an answer or prove that an external real-world outcome occurred without a system-of-record verifier. Raw prompts, responses, tool parameters and tool results are not stored by the Black Box; their SHA-256 digests and bounded metadata are.

Install AtMem beside OpenClaw, let it copy and shadow the complete native memory, inspect the result, then activate it when you are ready. Shadow mode does not change the context sent to the model. Activation freezes the verified OpenClaw memory state and replaces native supplemental-memory access with bounded AtMem recall. Restore puts the saved OpenClaw configuration and memory paths back.

This is **Version 1.0.0**, the first stable AtMem release. Agent Black Box capture and the automated copy, shadow, activation and restore workflow support OpenClaw first. The underlying memory engine and MCP interface remain model-agnostic.

## Inspect an agent flight

After installation, use OpenClaw normally and inspect newly observed runs:

```bash
atmem blackbox status
atmem blackbox runs
atmem blackbox verify RUN_ID
atmem blackbox export RUN_ID --format text --output flight.txt
atmem dashboard daemon start
```

The dashboard presents recent flights, tool-request/completion closure, terminal status, the host-observed timeline and downloadable JSON/text evidence. See the [Agent Black Box guide](docs/agent-blackbox.md) for the event model, privacy boundary and exact guarantees.

## Install and migrate OpenClaw

```bash
# 1. Install the engine. Do not install the npm bridge separately.
python -m pip install atmem==1.0.0
atmem --version

# 2. Install the matching bridge and copy all existing OpenClaw memory.
atmem openclaw install

# 3. Inspect the shadow copy. OpenClaw is still the memory provider.
atmem control status
atmem control verify
atmem dashboard daemon start

# 4. Switch only after the dashboard reports that the copy is verified.
atmem control activate

# 5. Restore OpenClaw memory at any time.
atmem control restore --drill
atmem control restore
```

`atmem openclaw install` owns both packages: it installs the matching npm bridge, binds the exact Python executable, copies `MEMORY.md` and `memory/*.md` from the beginning of the OpenClaw workspace history, starts change mirroring, restarts the gateway, and verifies the loaded integration. Progress is shown for every stage. If verification fails, it restores the prior plugin configuration. The command is safe to rerun: an existing shadow migration is refreshed and verified in place while its control ID and original restore snapshot are preserved.

Read the [OpenClaw setup](docs/openclaw-setup.md) and [control-plane guarantees](docs/control-plane.md) before customer deployment.

## Watch the OpenClaw walkthrough

The 1080p walkthrough demonstrates installation, complete native-memory mirroring, shadow-mode search and capture, verified activation, governed text and image memory, human approval, recall, audit investigation, and the available restore path.

- [Watch or download the video](https://github.com/aetna000/atmem/raw/v1.0.0/docs/showcases/openclaw-memory-control-plane/atmem-openclaw-memory-control-plane.mp4)
- [Read the voice-over transcript](https://github.com/aetna000/atmem/blob/v1.0.0/docs/showcases/openclaw-memory-control-plane/transcript.txt)

The demonstration states the product boundaries directly: shadow mode does not alter model context, image recall returns the approved text observation rather than image bytes, and restore is available but is not executed in the recording.

## What the dashboard provides

The loopback-only dashboard is the operating and investigation surface:

- current provider: OpenClaw in shadow mode or AtMem in active mode;
- copy progress, source manifest, hashes, and verification failures;
- memory search, record history, source and interpretation evidence;
- recall scores, context-injection receipts, and agent-response bindings;
- approval or purge of quarantined external observations;
- filtered audit exploration with time, event, actor, session, record, and status facets;
- JSON, NDJSON, CSV, text investigation reports, and deletion receipts;
- one activation control and one restore control.

```bash
atmem dashboard daemon start   # background service at http://127.0.0.1:8766/
atmem dashboard daemon open    # open the direct loopback URL
atmem dashboard daemon status
atmem dashboard daemon restart
atmem dashboard daemon stop
atmem dashboard daemon remove  # removes service metadata, not memory/evidence
```

## Model-agnostic engine

Any host that can launch a stdio MCP server can use the engine directly:

```bash
atmem mcp --db ~/.atmem/memories.db --subject local-user
```

MCP tools: `memory_remember`, `memory_observe`, `memory_recall`, `memory_get_record`, `memory_get_source`, `memory_recall_block`, `memory_persona`, `memory_context_pack`, `memory_capture`, `memory_list`, `memory_forget`, `memory_forget_artifact`, `memory_promote`, `memory_audit`, `memory_verify`, `memory_graph_status`, `memory_graph_merges`, `memory_graph_history`, and `memory_log_action`.

The protocol does not depend on OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, xAI, DeepSeek, or another model provider. A host integration is still responsible for authenticated user identity, deciding when model-interpreted statements become memory, and proving which context reached which response.

See the [integration guide](docs/integration-guide.md), [audit search](docs/audit-search.md), [semantic search](docs/semantic-search.md), and [multimodal observations](docs/multimodal-observations.md).

## Data and trust boundaries

- Canonical memory, provenance, lifecycle state, and audit evidence are stored in SQLite.
- Semantic search is optional. Vectors are a derived index and are verified against canonical records before results are returned.
- External media bytes remain host-controlled. AtMem stores a typed text observation, exact byte-stream SHA-256, model identity, and host reference.
- External observations are quarantined until approved. Confidence is evidence, never an automatic promotion rule.
- Forget operations cascade through canonical, graph, media, and vector-derived state and return a receipt.
- The dashboard binds only to loopback and opens without a login. Mutations retain CSRF and origin checks.

## Scope

AtMem 1.0 contains one product: the memory control plane. Unrelated legacy experiments remain in Git history and on the unchanged `develop` branch; they are not shipped as part of the 1.0 product.
